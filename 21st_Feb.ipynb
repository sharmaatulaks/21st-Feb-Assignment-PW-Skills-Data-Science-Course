    "Ans 1:- Web scraping refers to the process of automatically extracting data from websites, typically through the use of specialized software tools. This process involves analyzing the HTML code of a webpage and extracting relevant information, such as text, images, and links. Web scraping is used in various fields, including business, research, and data analysis, to gather large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons why web scraping is used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data collection: Web scraping allows businesses and researchers to collect large amounts of data from various sources quickly and efficiently. This data can be used for market research, competitor analysis, and product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Price monitoring: Web scraping is often used to monitor prices of products on e-commerce websites. This information can be used to adjust prices to remain competitive or to identify trends in consumer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis: Web scraping is also used in social media analysis and sentiment analysis. By extracting text data from social media websites, researchers can analyze the opinions and attitudes of users towards various topics or brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is commonly used to get data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* E-commerce: Web scraping is used by businesses to collect data on product prices, reviews, and ratings from e-commerce websites such as Flipkart, Amazon, Walmart, and eBay.\n",

    "Ans 2:- There are various methods used for web scraping, some of which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parsing HTML: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a webpage to extract relevant data. This can be done using programming languages like Python or PHP, which have libraries and modules specifically designed for web scraping. The extracted data can then be stored in a structured format such as CSV or JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access their data in a structured manner. APIs provide a more controlled way of accessing data, which can be useful for web scraping purposes. However, not all websites offer APIs, and some APIs may require payment or authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scraping tools: There are various scraping tools available that can be used to extract data from websites. These tools may be browser extensions, desktop software, or web-based applications. They usually require minimal coding knowledge and allow users to extract data by simply selecting the relevant elements on a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web crawling: Web crawling involves the use of automated bots to navigate through websites and extract data. These bots can follow links, collect data from multiple pages, and store the data in a database. Web crawling can be useful for extracting data from large websites or for monitoring changes in website content over time.\n"
